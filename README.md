## 🛠️ Deployment to Netlify

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push all the files to your repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to GitHub and select your repository
4. Build settings:
   - **Build command:** Leave empty (it's a static site)
   - **Publish directory:** `/` (root)
5. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Enable Netlify Identity (for Admin Access)

1. Once deployed, go to your site's dashboard
2. Go to **"Identity"** tab
3. Click **"Enable Identity"**
4. Go to **"Settings"** (in Identity)
5. Under **"Registration preferences"**, select **"Invite only"**
6. Under **"Git Gateway"**, click **"Enable Git Gateway"**

### Step 4: Create Admin User

1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to **Identity** tab
2. Click **"Invite users"**
3. Enter your customer's email address
4. They'll receive an invitation email
5. They click the link, set a password, and they're in!

### Step 5: Add Identity Widget to Your Site

The admin pages already include the Netlify Identity widget, but you need to add a small snippet to allow users to logout. Add this before the closing `</body>` tag in your index.html:

```html
<script>
  if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
    window.netlifyIdentity.on("init", user => {
      if (!user) {
        window.netlifyIdentity.on("login", () => {
          document.location.href = "/admin/";
        });
      }
    });
  }
</script>
```

## 🎨 Using the Admin Panel

### For Your Customer (Site Owner):

1. Go to: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin/`
2. Log in with the credentials from the invitation email
3. Click "Cars" in the sidebar
4. Click "New Car" to add a vehicle

### Adding a New Car:

## 🎯 Custom Domain Setup

### Step 1: Buy a Domain

Buy a domain from any registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.)

### Step 2: Configure in Netlify

1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **"Domain settings"**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `eliteautogallery.com`)
4. Follow the instructions to update your DNS records

### Step 3: Enable HTTPS

## 📝 Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `css/styles.css` and modify the `:root` variables at the top:

```css
:root {
  --slate-900: #0f172a;  /* Change to your color */
  --emerald-500: #10b981; /* Change to your color */
}
```

### Changing Logo

Replace the logo URL in all HTML files:
```html
<img src="YOUR_LOGO_URL" alt="Your Company Name">
```

### Changing Phone Number

Update in `car-details.html`:
```html
<a href="tel:YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER">
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Cars Not Showing Up?

1. Check that you've published the car (not just saved as draft)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify to rebuild
3. Check the Status is set to "Available"

### Admin Panel Not Working?

1. Make sure Netlify Identity is enabled
2. Check that Git Gateway is enabled

2. Check the `media_folder` setting in `admin/config.yml`
3. Verify images are in the `images/cars/` folder
