5. **Scroll down**
6. Commit message: `Fix admin index.html - add CMS code`
7. **Click "Commit changes"**

### **STEP 2: Wait for Render to Redeploy**

Render will detect the GitHub change and redeploy automatically (2-3 minutes).

---

### **STEP 3: Clear Your Browser Cache**

This is important!

1. **Press** `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` (Mac)
2. **Select** "Cached images and files"
3. **Click** "Clear data"

**OR just use Incognito/Private mode:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Chrome) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Firefox)
2. Visit: `https://elite-auto-test.onrender.com/admin`

---

### **STEP 4: Test Again**

1. Go to: `https://elite-auto-test.onrender.com/admin`
2. You should see **Netlify CMS login screen** (not "Not Found")
3. Click "Login with GitHub"
4. Authorize
5. **Admin panel should load!** ✅

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS WILL FIX IT:

The current `index.html` file is probably empty or has the wrong content. The code I gave you:
1. ✅ Loads Netlify CMS library
2. ✅ Loads Netlify Identity widget
3. ✅ Creates the admin panel interface
4. ✅ Connects to your `config.yml`

## 📋 WHAT YOU'LL SEE AFTER:

**Instead of "Not Found", you'll see:**
```
[Netlify CMS Logo]

Content Manager

[Login with GitHub Button]
```

Then after logging in:
```
